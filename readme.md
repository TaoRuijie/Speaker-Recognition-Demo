# Speaker Recognition Demo

This code is modified based on https://github.com/clovaai/voxceleb_trainer , include the pretrain model. This is just a simply version of that repository for the 'demo' purpose.

## What can it do ?
This code can output the recognition scores between the test utterance (the utterance you want to know the the speaker id) and all enrollment utterances (the utterances you have registed and already known the speaker id) based on the person's unique voiceprint.

## How to use ?

### Clone the code:

```
git clone https://github.com/TaoRuijie/SpeakerRecognitionDemo
```

### Input: 
  
  Put the wav files you have registed in the `data/enrollment_audio` folder. Put the wav file you want to test in `data/test_audio` folder (You can put multiple test audio file, each test audio will generate one score list).

### Command:

```
python demoSpeakerNet.py
```

### Output: 
  
  The score is the speaker recognition score between the test utterance and all enrollment utterances, the score is higher, the utterance tends to come from the same speaker (The highest is 0.0).  
  
  For instance: There are 7 audios in `data/enrollment_audio` and 1 audio in `data/test_audio`. You can get the following output:


|    |     A1 |
| -- | ------ |
| A2 | -0.8122|
| D2 | -1.2551|
| D1 | -1.2641|
| B1 | -1.3041|
| C2 | -1.3062|
| B2 | -1.3246|
| C1 | -1.3756|

	
`A1` and `A2` come from the same speaker, so they have the highest score.

## Other issue:

- Audio file format

	Current only wav, any sampling rate, single/dual channel is fine. 

- Requirements

	Pytorch (>=1.6.0), pandas, soundfile package
	
- GPU
	
	This is just the demo code, so the default setting is to use cpu only. It will not be very slow.

- Threshold setting

	It depends on the dataset. Just for suggestion: usually the score between 0 to -1.0 can be viewed as the same speaker, score small than -1.0 can be viewed as different speaker.
